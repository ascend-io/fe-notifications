# Ascend Build-an-app Challenge

## Requirements
In this exercise, you'll be tasked to build a small app:
- Upon button click, display a notification in the left part of the screen
- Each notification contains an encouraging note, and after 5 seconds, automatically disappears
- A user may dismiss a notification before it disappears, by clicking "x"

## Bonus!
- Make the app prettier
- Display a progress bar to show how soon the notification will disappear
- Anything else you can think of!
